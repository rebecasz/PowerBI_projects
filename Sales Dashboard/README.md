<h1>Sales Dashboard </h1>
A company wants to analyze its sales data to identify trends and make data-driven decisions. They use Power BI to create a sales dashboard that displays key metrics such as sales by region, sales by product, and sales trends over time. The dashboard is connected to the company's data sources, such as their sales database and Excel spreadsheets.<br>

The dashboard includes visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and maps to help the company quickly understand its sales data. The visualizations are interactive, allowing users to drill down into specific data points or filter the data by different criteria.
